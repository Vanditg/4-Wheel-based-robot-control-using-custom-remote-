# 4-Wheel-based-robot-control-using-custom-remote-
This project is all about to control the 4-based hybrid robot using custom remote. Basically coding has been done on python and the processor used for the project is Raspberry-PI, first we have define the pins in which are some input pins for buttons and some output pins for motors and we have made code according to that so we can change the motor speed according to given PWM, and also we have added a special button for which if in emergency the robot won't stop then with help of the button the power will be discarded from the motors.
